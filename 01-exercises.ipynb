    "1 - How would you define Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is the ability for computers to run/execute tasks without being explicitly programmed. It is the art of computers making decisions from data. Learning gets better at some task, measured by some performace measure.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "2 - Can you name four types of problems where it shines?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spam filtering (a machine can automatically detect if a new e-mail is spam or non-spam)\n",
    "- Ride hailing (an algorithm can automatically match riders to drivers)\n",
    "- Recommendation of products in e-commerce / recommendation of ads in search engines (an algorithm can predict what a customer needs based on his/her browsing / buying activity and serve recommendations to them)\n",
    "- Machine translation (an ML algorithm can automatically take excerpts of text in 1 language and translate to another)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally it will shane when the problem has a solution which needs many rules, very complex porblems where there is no good solution using a traditional approach, or problems where the environments fluctuate over time.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - What is a labeled training set?\n",
    "\n",
    "A labelled training set is used in supervised learning problems. It is a dataset that already has their assigned classes / values, and is given to the model to learn parameters so it can predict with better accuracy / precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "4 - What are the two most common supervised tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression\n",
    "- Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "5 - Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clustering (e.g. k-means)\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction e.g. Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "- Association rule learning\n",
    "- Anomaly detection\n",

    "7 - What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?\n",

    "8 - Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning problem. The model will be given its labels of spam and non-spam before training\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "9 - What is an online learning system?\n",
    "\n",
    "A model is trained incrementally using data instances sequentially either individually or with small groups called mini-batches. The model can learn on the fly. Online learning is good when the system receives data in a stream or the computing resources are limited (and hence cannot perform batch learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "10 - What is out-of-core-learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of core learning occurs when a system trains the model on small blocks of data because the dataset is too large to be loaded onto main memory. The system loads the block, trains the model and then repeats until the full dataset is used for training. This applies to online learning systems."

It is set before the training step. Tuning hyperparameters is important to building a Machine Learning system.\n",

The model learns by searching for optimal values of paremeters so the model will generalize well to new instance. Given a new sample, the model inputs the features from the sample and the learned parameters from the model to make its prediction.\n",

Insufficient data, model is not able to detect the underlying pattern to make good quality predictions\n",

    "\n",
    "Model is overfitting on the training data. If this happens, either perform hyperparameter tuning to allow it to generalise better on the new instances / select a different model for training, obtaining more data for training or to perform better feature engineering (feature selection / extraction) for training."
